This repository contains code for analyzing and modeling a Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset using Python. The code includes data preprocessing, machine learning model training, and evaluation of model performance. Below, you will find a brief overview of the main components and steps of the project.

Overview
Objective: The objective of this project is to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) on a dataset using various machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

Dataset: The project utilizes two datasets, 'ner.csv' and 'ner_dataset.csv', which contain information related to named entities.

Project Components
The project consists of the following major components:

1. Data Preprocessing
The code begins by importing necessary Python libraries such as seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and others for data analysis and visualization.

Two datasets, 'ner.csv' and 'ner_dataset.csv', are read into DataFrames for further analysis.

Data exploration is performed to understand the structure and content of the datasets. For example, the code displays the columns and the first few rows of the 'ner' DataFrame.

Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values and encoding categorical features. Label encoding is used to convert categorical data to numerical format for machine learning models.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The code includes various data visualization techniques using matplotlib to gain insights into the data. Scatter plots and bar plots are used to visualize relationships between different features and tags.
3. Machine Learning Models
Several machine learning models are implemented to perform NER tasks. The code includes the following models:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
K-Nearest Neighbors
Decision Tree
For each model, the code trains the model on the training set, makes predictions on the test set, and evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Additionally, the code calculates quality metrics for multiple documents or queries, including Weighted Information Gain (WIG), Normalized Query Count (NQC), Mean Quality Factor (QF), and Mean Cohesion.

Usage
To run the code and analyze the NER dataset:

Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (e.g., numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, etc.) installed.

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Place the 'ner.csv' and 'ner_dataset.csv' files in the same directory as the code.

Execute the code in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script).

Follow the code comments to understand each step of the analysis and model training.
